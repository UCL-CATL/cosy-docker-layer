cosy-docker-layer
=================

Common [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) layer.

The goal is to have something convenient/cozy. The disk space is not a problem
for us, as long as the layer is shared. So we prefer to have a simple
Dockerfile instead of trying to install the bare minimum dependencies.
